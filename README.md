# MSPPG
Multiwii Serial Protocol Parser Generator for Python, Java, and C++

Instructions 

The script msppg.py is ready to-run using your favorite Python interpreter: command-line, IDLE, etc.  To install so you can run it anywhere, do

% python setup.py install

from a Windows command shell, or

% sudo python setup.py install

in Unix (Linux, OS X).

Once the package is installed, you can put your example.json file anywhere and run the following:

% msppg.py example.json

which will create output/python, output/java/, output/cpp, and output/arduino. You can cd to one of the
first three output directories and do

% make test

to test the code.  In output/python you can also run the msp-imudisplay.py program, which uses Tkinter and NumPy to visualize the Attitude messages coming from a flight controller (tested with AcroNaze running Baseflight).  In output/java you can do

% make jar

to build the msppg.jar file, which can then be used as a library for Android projects and other Java-based work.

The Arduino example allows you to control the pitch of a buzzer using the pitch from the IMU. You should use an Arduino Mega or other Arduino that has TX1/RX1 pins, and make the following connections:

(1) Naze - to Arduino ground.
(2) Naze + to Arduino 5v.
(3) Naze TX to Arduino RX1.
(4) Naze RX to Arduino TX1.
(5) Buzzer + to Arduino digitial 8.
(6) Buzzer - to Arduino ground.

Then copy the output/arduino/MSPPG folder into your Arduino libaries folder, launch the Arduino IDE, and find the MSPPG submenu under the File/Examples menu.

The msp-example.json file currently contains just a few message specifications, but you can easily add to it by specifying additional messages from the MSP: http://www.multiwii.com/wiki/index.php?title=Multiwii_Serial_Protocol. 
MSPPG currently supports types byte, short, and float, but we will likely add int as the need arises.
